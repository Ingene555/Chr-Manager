# Chr Manager

## Description

**Chr Manager** is one of my earliest projects. This program's goal is to display all the characters available on the computer and allow you to manipulate them.

The original name, **Symbols**, comes from a time when I didn't yet speak English. The first version of the project dates back to 2021. At that time, the code was quite cryptic, disorganized, hard to understand, and used excessive resources.

In 2023, I decided to rewrite and optimize it. The project now only uses the **Tkinter** library.

I highly recommend trying out the new version, but I am also publishing the old version to show the evolution of my skills over time.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of a personal exercise to explore the **Tkinter** library. It was not created for any profit or commercial purposes. Therefore, I want to emphasize that it is **open to anyone who wants to use it**.

Thank you for your interest!
